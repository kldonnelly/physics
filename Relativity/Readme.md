>What are the axioms of special relativity?

Special relativity is based on two fundamental postulates (axioms) formulated by Albert Einstein in 1905. These axioms are:

1. **The Principle of Relativity (First Postulate):**  
   - The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames (i.e., frames moving at constant velocity relative to one another).  
   - This means there is no preferred or absolute frame of reference; only relative motion between frames matters.

2. **The Constancy of the Speed of Light (Second Postulate):**  
   - The speed of light in a vacuum (\( c \)) is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer.  
   - This implies that \( c \) is a universal constant (approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)) and does not depend on the relative velocity between the source and the observer.

### Consequences of These Axioms:
From these two postulates, Einstein derived revolutionary consequences, including:
- **Time Dilation:** Moving clocks run slower compared to stationary ones.
- **Length Contraction:** Objects in motion appear shorter along the direction of motion.
- **Relativity of Simultaneity:** Events simultaneous in one frame may not be in another.
- **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** \( E = mc^2 \), showing that energy and mass are interchangeable.

These axioms reject Newtonian notions of absolute time and space, leading to the Lorentz transformations (which replace Galilean transformations) as the correct way to relate measurements between inertial frames.

>Is the second axiom necessary, can it be derived from the first?

The second axiom of special relativity—the constancy of the speed of light—cannot be derived from the first axiom alone (the principle of relativity). However, it can be *replaced* or *generalized* under certain assumptions. Here's a deeper analysis:

### 1. **Why the Second Axiom is Not Strictly Necessary**
The second postulate (constancy of *c*) is a special case of a more general requirement:  
- **There exists a finite, invariant speed in nature.**  

This speed could, in principle, be infinite (which would recover Newtonian mechanics) or finite (which leads to relativity). Experimentally, we know this speed is finite and corresponds to *c* (the speed of light in vacuum).  

If we replace the second postulate with:  
- **"There exists a finite, invariant speed for all inertial observers,"**  
then the value of this speed (*c*) must be determined empirically. Light just happens to propagate at this speed in vacuum, but the postulate is really about spacetime structure, not light itself.

### 2. **Deriving the Invariant Speed from the First Postulate?**
No, the first postulate alone is not enough. The principle of relativity (first postulate) only demands that the laws of physics be the same in all inertial frames, but it does not specify whether:  
- There is an infinite speed (Galilean relativity, where simultaneity is absolute), or  
- There is a finite invariant speed (Einsteinian relativity, where *c* is universal).  

Additional assumptions (e.g., spacetime homogeneity, isotropy, and causality) can lead to the conclusion that transformations between inertial frames must be either:  
- Galilean (with *c* → ∞), or  
- Lorentzian (with *c* finite).  

But to pick the Lorentzian case (special relativity), we must *either*:  
- Assume the second postulate (constancy of *c*), or  
- Assume a different but equally strong postulate (e.g., "causality is preserved in all frames").  

### 3. **Historical and Theoretical Justifications**
- Einstein originally used the light-speed postulate because Maxwell's equations (which describe electromagnetism) predict that light moves at *c* in vacuum, and experiments (e.g., Michelson-Morley) showed no dependence on the observer's motion.  
- Later, theorists like Vladimir Ignatowski (1910) showed that if you assume only relativity, homogeneity, isotropy, and causality, you can derive that the transformations must be Lorentz-like, with some undetermined invariant speed. Then, experiments fix this speed as *c*.


### **Conclusion**
The second postulate is *not* derivable from the first alone, but it can be *reformulated* in a more general way (e.g., "there exists a finite invariant speed"). Without *some* additional constraint beyond the first postulate, we could end up with either Galilean or Einsteinian relativity. The choice is ultimately empirical: experiments show that the invariant speed is finite and matches *c*.  

Thus, while the *specific* statement about light is not strictly necessary, *some* equivalent postulate about the structure of spacetime is required to get special relativity.

>first axiom plus that space is homogeneous and isotropic 

Yes! If we start with:  
1. **The Principle of Relativity** (laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames),  
2. **Homogeneity of Space and Time** (no preferred location or moment),  
3. **Isotropy of Space** (no preferred direction),  

then, under reasonable assumptions (like causality and group structure for transformations between frames), we can **derive** the existence of a **finite, invariant speed**—without explicitly postulating the constancy of the speed of light.  

This was first shown by **Vladimir Ignatowski (1910)** and later refined by others (e.g., Lévy-Leblond, Berzi & Gorini). Here’s how it works:

### **Key Steps in the Derivation**
1. **Assume linearity of transformations** (from homogeneity).  
2. **Demand that inertial frames are equivalent** (relativity principle).  
3. **Impose isotropy** (no directional preference, ruling out preferred-frame effects like in Galilean relativity).  
4. **Require causality** (no event can influence another faster than some finite speed).  

From these, the only possible transformations between inertial frames are:  
- **Galilean transformations** (with an **infinite invariant speed**, *c* → ∞), or  
- **Lorentz transformations** (with a **finite invariant speed**, *c* < ∞).  

Experiments (Michelson-Morley, particle accelerators, etc.) rule out the Galilean case, leaving us with special relativity and a finite *c*.

### **Why Light?**
The second postulate (constancy of *c*) was originally about light because:  
- Maxwell’s equations predict electromagnetic waves move at *c* in vacuum.  
- Einstein wanted electromagnetism to obey relativity (whereas Newtonian mechanics assumed instantaneous action).  

But **light itself is incidental**—the deeper postulate is that **spacetime has a finite invariant speed**, and light just happens to travel at it.  

### **Conclusion**
- **Yes**, the second postulate (constancy of *c*) can be replaced by **homogeneity + isotropy + causality**, leading to the same structure of special relativity.  
- The **value of *c*** must still come from experiment, but the framework emerges purely from symmetry principles.  

This approach is more fundamental, showing that special relativity is a consequence of **spacetime symmetries**, not just electromagnetism.
